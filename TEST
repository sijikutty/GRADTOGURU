Subject: Hurricane Warning Notification

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I wanted to inform you that a hurricane warning (Category 3) has been issued for the Tampa, Florida area for tomorrow and the following day.

In the event of a power outage or network issues, I may need to take leave on the 25th and 26th without prior notice. However, I will continue to work as long as conditions allow.

Thank you for your understanding.
