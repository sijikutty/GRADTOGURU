Hi Team,

We had an issue with IB earlier and it was resolved. It came back again now.


Integration Broker Message/Operation Instances are Stuck in Status NEW in FGL2D.

Could you please help. This automation is part of current sprint ,so we will be waiting for resolution soon.
I am attaching the previous email trail, as it might help you to track old issue cause.
