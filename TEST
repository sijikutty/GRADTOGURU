I have modified delivered XML Publisher packages to send an email to the distribution list only if there was data on report. This was needed to save user time, if no data on report no need to open the report.
The above query is run via XMLP framework every hour and sends our IT an email if something was stuck.
You write your own app engine calling this Query (or running a similar SQL) to achieve this.
