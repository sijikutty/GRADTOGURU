We are currently working on a project for automating PeopleSoft test cases, and we aim to execute it under a service account to allow access for all team members. However, we are facing a challenge: Single Sign-On (SSO) login is not available for service accounts. Without SSO, we are unable to configure access to AWS, where all our data is stored.

Could you please assist us in resolving this issue?
