Explanation
Use of {{ and }}: Double curly braces are used to escape braces in f-strings for the JavaScript code.

scrollIntoView Options: Adding behavior: 'smooth' and block: 'center' ensures a smoother scrolling effect and positions the element in the center of the viewport.

setTimeout: Added a slight delay before clicking to ensure that the element is fully rendered and visible.

Error Handling: Error messages are printed to provide feedback if something goes wrong.

By ensuring the JavaScript code is correctly formatted and tested, you should be able to resolve the issues related to element visibility and interaction within the iframe.
