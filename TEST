My system got stuck at 30% during the upgrade process and entered an endless restart loop. Unfortunately, I ultimately had to replace the entire system, resulting in the loss of all my data, except for what was recovered from OneDrive. This situation cost me four valuable workdays.

Here are the key points regarding the upgrade failure:

There were no backup files available for HP Recovery; the system pointed to a location that was empty.
Advanced repair options did not appear as expected.
I performed several tests, including hard drive and network tests, all of which passed, yet the system continued to fail to restart.
I learned the hard way not to upgrade over Wi-Fi.
